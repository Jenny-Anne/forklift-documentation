[role="_abstract"]
Cold migration is when a powered *_off_* virtual machine (VM) is migrated to a separate host. The VM is powered off, and there is no need for common shared storage.

Warm migration is when a powered *_on_* VM is migrated to a separate host. A source host state is cloned to the destination host.
