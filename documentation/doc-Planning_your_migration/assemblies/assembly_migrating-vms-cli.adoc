= Migrating virtual machines by using the command-line interface

//:context: migrating-vms-cli

[role="_abstract"]

You migrate virtual machines (VMs) to {virt} from the command-line by creating {project-short} custom resources (CRs). The CRs and the migration procedure vary by source provider.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must specify a name for cluster-scoped CRs.

You must specify both a name and a namespace for namespace-scoped CRs.

To migrate to or from an {ocp-short} cluster that is different from the one the migration plan is defined on, you must have an {virt} service account token with `cluster-admin` privileges.

[IMPORTANT]

You must ensure that all prerequisites are met. For more information, see xref:assembly_prerequisites-for-migration_{context}[Prerequisites for migration].
