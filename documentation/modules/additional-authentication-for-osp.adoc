= Additional authentication methods for migrations with {osp} source providers

[role="_abstract"]
{project-full} supports the following authentication methods for migrations with {osp} source providers in addition to the standard username and password credential set:

* Token authentication
* Application credential authentication

You can use these methods to migrate virtual machines with {osp} source providers using the command-line interface (CLI) the same way you migrate other virtual machines, except for how you prepare the `Secret` manifest.
