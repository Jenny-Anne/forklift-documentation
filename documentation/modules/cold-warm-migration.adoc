= Warm migration precopy and cutover

The following high-level steps describe the precopy and cutover stages of a warm migration.

== Preparing the precopy stage for a warm migration

. Create an initial snapshot of running VM disks.
. Copy first snapshot to target: full-disk transfer, the largest amount of data copied. It takes more time to complete.
. Copy deltas: changed data, copying only data that has changed since the last snapshot was taken. It takes less time to complete.
.. Create a new snapshot.
.. Copy the delta between the previous snapshot and the new snapshot.
.. Schedule the next snapshot, configurable by default, one hour after the last snapshot finished.
. An arbitrary number of deltas can be copied.


== Preparing the cutover stage for a warm migration

. Scheduled time to finalize warm migration
. Shut down the source VM.
. Copy the final snapshot delta to the target.
. Continue in the same way as cold migration
.. Guest conversion
.. Starting target VM (optional)
