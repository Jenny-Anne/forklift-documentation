= Migrating virtual machines by using the MTV user interface

[role="_abstract"]
Use the {project-short} user interface to migrate virtual machines (VMs) from the following providers:

* VMware vSphere
* {rhv-full} ({rhv-short})
* {osp}
* Open Virtual Appliances (OVAs) that were created by VMware vSphere
* {virt} clusters

For all migrations, you specify the source provider, the destination provider, and the migration plan. The specific procedures vary per provider.

[IMPORTANT]

You must ensure that all prerequisites are met. For more information, see xref:assembly_prerequisites-for-migration_{context}[Prerequisites for migration].

VMware only: You must have the minimal set of xref:vmware-privileges_{context}[VMware privileges].

VMware only: Creating a xref:creating-vddk-image_{context}[VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK)] image will increase migration speed.
