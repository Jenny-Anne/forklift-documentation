Based on the preceding information, the following conclusions can be drawn about cold migration vs. warm migration:

* The shortest downtime of VMs can be achieved by using warm migration.
* The shortest duration for VMs with a large amount of data on a single disk can be achieved by using cold migration.
* The shortest duration for VMs with a large amount of data that is spread evenly across multiple disks can be achieved by using warm migration.
