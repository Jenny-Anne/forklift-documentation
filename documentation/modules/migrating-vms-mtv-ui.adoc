= Migrating virtual machines using the MTV user interface

[role="_abstract"] 
Use the {project-short} user interface to migrate VMs from the following providers:

* {vmw} vSphere
* {rhv-full} ({rhv-short})
* {osp}
* Open Virtual Appliances (OVAs) that were created by {vmw} vSphere
* {virt} clusters

For all migrations, you specify the source provider, the destination provider, and the migration plan. The specific procedures vary per provider.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must ensure that all xref:prerequisites-for-all-providers_mtv[Prerequisites and software requirements for all providers] and all xref:prerequisites-per-provider_mtv[Specific software requirements for each provider] are met.

{vmw} only: You must have the minimal set of xref:vmware-privileges_mtv[{vmw} privileges].

{vmw} only: Creating a xref:creating-vddk-image_mtv[{vmw} Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK)] image increases migration speed.
