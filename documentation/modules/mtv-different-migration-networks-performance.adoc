[id="mtv-different-migration-network-performances_{context}"]
= Performance using different migration networks

[role="_abstract"]
Each iteration the `Migration Network` was changed, by using the *Provider*, to find the fastest network for migration.

The results indicate that there is no degradation by using management compared to non-management networks when all interfaces and network speeds are the same.
