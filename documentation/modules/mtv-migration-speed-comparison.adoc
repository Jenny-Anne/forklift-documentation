= Migration speed comparison

[role="_abstract"]
Comparing the migration speeds of cold and warm migrations, you can observe that:

* The observed speeds for the warm migration single disk transfer and disk conversion are approximately the same as for the cold migration.

* The benefit of warm migration is that the transfer of the snapshot happens in the background while the VM is powered *_on_*.

* The default snapshot time is taken every 60 minutes. If VMs change substantially, more data needs to be transferred than in cold migration when the VM is powered *_off_*.

* The cutover time, meaning the shutdown of the VM and last snapshot transfer, depends on how much the VM has changed since the last snapshot.
