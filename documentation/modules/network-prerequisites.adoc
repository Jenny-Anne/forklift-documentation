= Network prerequisites

[role="_abstract"]
The following network prerequisites apply to all migrations:

* Do not change IP addresses, VLANs, and other network configuration settings during a migration. The MAC addresses of the virtual machines (VMs) are preserved during migration.
* The network connections between the source environment, the {virt} cluster, and the replication repository must be reliable and uninterrupted.
* If you are mapping more than one source and destination network, you must create a link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/{ocp-version}/html/virtualization/virtual-machines#virt-creating-network-attachment-definition[network attachment definition] for each additional destination network.
