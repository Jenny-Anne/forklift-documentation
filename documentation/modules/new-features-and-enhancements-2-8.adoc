{project-first} 2.8 introduces the following features and enhancements:

* In {project-short} 2.8.0, you can provide custom names for the following attributes in the migration plan of VMware virtual machines (VMs):
+ 
** Persistent volume claim (PVC) name template that is used to generate PVC names in the target VM. 
** Volume name template that is used to generate volume interface names for the target VMs.
** Network name template that is used to generate network interface names for the target VMs.

* In {project-short} 2.8.0, VM names can contain periods, as described in link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123[(RFC-1123)]. This allows you to use Fully Qualified Domain Names in VM names after migration. 

* VMware and OVA only: In {project-short} 2.8.1, you can specify the name of a target VM for migrations done by using the CLI. The name you enter must be unique, and it must also be a valid Kubernetes subdomain. Otherwise, the migration fails automatically.

* Migration by using the CLI only: In {project-short} 2.8.1, you can avoid mapping a network when you create a migration plan. 

* VMware only: By default, {project-short} adds one or more randomly generated alphanumeric characters to the names of PVCs to ensure that all PVCs have unique names. In {project-short} 2.8.2, you can instruct {project-short} to not add such suffixes. However, if you choose this option, the generated PVC names might not be unique, which could cause a migration to fail.
