.User experience was interrupted during storage migration due to device discovery timeouts

In previous versions of {project-short}, the absence of device discovery timeouts during storage offload migration on `ESXi` hosts previously caused unreliable device rescanning, disrupting user experience during storage migration. Now, a timeout has been implemented for device discovery during offload migration, ensuring that device discovery no longer times out and promoting smoother data transfer during storage offload migration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3297[(MTV-3297)]

.Duplicate persistent routes caused network routing issues leading to potential connectivity problems

In this release of {project-short}, during cold migration with `preserve static IP: on`, the script now actively deletes old persistent routes after setting the static IP, preventing the creation of duplicate persistent routes. This enhancement improves network routing, thereby minimizing potential connectivity issues. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3304[(MTV-3304)]

.User experienced loss of network connectivity due to migration as only 3 out of 4 static IPs were preserved

In previous versions of {project-short}, users may have encountered network connectivity issues during virtual machine (VM) warm migration, as the network-config.ps1 script added gateway entries for static IPs on a NIC with numerous addresses multiple times, leading to the loss of network connectivity. In this release, the network configuration script has been actively modified to preserve all IP addresses during warm migration, ensuring network connectivity for many users. This enhancement guarantees that all static IP addresses are actively preserved during warm migration. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3303[(MTV-3303)]

.Default gateway setting lost during VM migration, causing connectivity issues for the user

In this release of {project-short}, there is an implementation of default gateway preservation during cold migration of a Windows Server 2019 VM from vCenter 7 to {ocp} Container Platform (OCP). Previously, the network configuration script failed to properly maintain the gateway setting, causing the default gateway to be lost and resulting in connectivity issues for end users. With this release, the default gateway is now actively preserved during cold migration, ensuring network connectivity for users. For clarity, acronyms such as OCP are defined on their first occurrence. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3302[(MTV-3302)]

.User operations are complicated due to loss of {vmw} disk name to Windows drive letter mapping in {virt} migration

In this release of {project-short}, the inflexible persistent volume claim (PVC) name template previously causing {vmw} disk name mapping loss during {virt} migration has been addressed. This issue led to complex user operations due to the loss of {vmw} disk name to Windows drive letter mapping in {virt} migration. Now, with this release, the PVC name template supports {vmw} disk names for Windows drive letter mapping, resulting in PVC names mapping to Windows drive letters, thereby simplifying operations. https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2403[(MTV-2403)]

.User unable to create a plan with a `Pre-migration` hook on {ocp} 4.17 that requires manual plan recreation

In previous versions of {project-short}, an issue occurred when users tried to create a plan with a `Pre-migration` hook on {ocp} 4.17.35, resulting in a failure during plan creation on {project-short} 2.9.0. Previously, manual plan recreation was necessary. With this release, the problem causing plan creation failure with a Pre-migration hook in {project-short} 2.9.0 on {ocp-name} 4.17.35 has been rectified. Consequently, users can now effortlessly create migration plans with Pre-migration hooks on {ocp-name} 4.17.35, thereby eliminating the need for manual plan recreation. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2918[(MTV-2918)]


.User could not select specific storages from the picklist when creating a plan with {rhv-short} provider, causing difficulty in resource allocation

In previous versions of {project-short}, reproducing a plan with {rhv-full} source provider previously resulted in an incorrect mapping selection, causing the *Storages used by the selected VMs* picklist to be empty. This issue made it challenging for users to select specific storages when creating a plan with {rhv-short} provider, affecting resource allocation. With this release, plan creation with {rhv-short} provider now correctly populates the *Storages used by the selected VMs* picklist, resulting in a more accurate storage mapping during plan creation, enhancing user experience. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-3185[(MTV-3185)]

.User was unable to automatically determine network and storage maps for VMs in a plan with {rhv-short} provider, causing manual guesswork

In previous versions of {project-short}, the auto-calculation and setting of network and storage map values for selected Virtual Machines (VMs) during plan creation with a {rhv-short} provider was not displayed, making it difficult for users to automatically determine network and storage maps for VMs in a plan with an RHV provider. This required manual guesswork. However, in this release, plan creation with {rhv-short} now automatically calculates and sets network and storage maps for selected VMs, enhancing the user experience. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-2790[(MTV-2790)]

.The user experienced empty VM list when the network was slow, affecting VM management

In previous versions of {project-short}, slow network conditions led to failures when listing provider VMs, resulting in an empty VM list for users managing VMs. Improved network performance for listing provider VMs in {rhv-short} has been implemented in this release. This release addresses that issue, improving the speed of VM listing on slow networks in a {rhv-short} provider. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1575[(MTV-1575)]
