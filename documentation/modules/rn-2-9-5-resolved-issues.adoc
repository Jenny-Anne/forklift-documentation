.Migrated VMs do not contain the `vm.kubevirt.io/workload` annotation

In previous releases of {project-short}, the migration of Virtual Machines (VMs) from VMware to {ocp-full} Virtualization did not preserve the `vm.kubevirt.io/workload` annotation, hindering workload profile setting. Consequently, end users were unable to set workload profiles for migrated VMware VMs.

With this release of {project-short}, we have added the `vm.kubevirt.io/workload` annotation to the YAML of migrated VMs. As a result, users can now set workload profiles for migrated VMware VMs.
