.Advantages and disadvantages of cold and warm migrations
|===
|
|*Cold migration*
|*Warm migration*

|*Duration*
|Correlates to the amount of data on the disks. Each block is copied once.
|Correlates to the amount of data on the disks and VM utilization. Blocks may be copied multiple times.

|*Fail fast*
|Convert and then transfer.
|Transfer and then convert.

|*Tools*
a|`virt-v2v` (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9), used to convert virtual machines from a foreign hypervisor to run on Kernel-based Virtual Machines (KVMs).
a|Containerized Data Importer (CDI), a persistent storage management add-on, and `virt-v2v` (Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9)

|*Data transferred*
|Approximate sum of all disks
|Approximate sum of all disks and VM utilization

|*VM downtime*
|High: The VMs are shut down, and the disks are transferred.
|Low: Disks are transferred in the background. The VMs are shut down during the cutover stage, and the remaining data is migrated. Data stored in RAM is not migrated.

|*Parallelism*
|Disks are transferred sequentially for each VM. For remote migration, disks are transferred in parallel.
footnoteref:[footnote1,Remote migration: Target environment that does not have MTV installed. Migration to a remote environment using CDI.]
|Disks are transferred in parallel by different pods.

|*Connection use*
|Keeps the connection to the Source only during the disk transfer.
|Keeps the connection to the Source during the disk transfer, but the connection is released between snapshots.
