.Windows VMs which use `Measured Boot` cannot be migrated

Microsoft Windows virtual machines (VMs), which use the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/measured-boot[Measured Boot] feature, cannot be migrated because Measured Boot is a mechanism to prevent any kind of device changes, by checking each start-up component, including the firmware, all the way to the boot driver.

The alternative to migration is to re-create the Windows VM directly on {virt}.
