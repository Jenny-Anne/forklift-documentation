= Source virtual machine prerequisites

[role="_abstract"]
The following prerequisites for source virtual machines (VMs) apply to all migrations:

* ISO images and CD-ROMs are unmounted.
* Each NIC contains either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address, although a NIC may use both.
* The operating system of each VM is certified and supported as a guest operating system for conversions.

[NOTE]
====
You can check that the operating system is supported by referring to the table in link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/1351473[Converting virtual machines from other hypervisors to KVM with virt-v2v]. See the columns of the table that refer to RHEL 8 hosts and RHEL 9 hosts.
====

* VMs that you want to migrate with MTV 2.6._z_ run on RHEL 8.
* VMs that you want to migrate with MTV 2.7._z_ run on RHEL 9.
* The name of a VM must not contain a period (`.`). {project-first} changes any period in a VM name to a dash (`-`).
* The name of a VM must not be the same as any other VM in the {virt} environment.

====
{project-full} automatically assigns a new name to a VM that does not comply with the rules.

{project-full} makes the following changes when it automatically generates a new VM name:

* Excluded characters are removed.
* Uppercase letters are switched to lowercase letters.
* Any underscore (`_`) is changed to a dash (`-`).

This feature allows a migration to proceed smoothly even if someone enters a VM name that does not follow the rules.

[NOTE]
====
Microsoft Windows VMs, which use the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/measured-boot[Measured Boot] feature, cannot be migrated. Measured Boot is a mechanism to prevent any kind of device changes by checking each start-up component, including the firmware, all the way to the boot driver.

The alternative to migration is to re-create the Windows VM directly on {virt}.

[NOTE]
====
Virtual machines (VMs) with Secure Boot enabled currently might not be migrated automatically. This is because Secure Boot would prevent the VMs from booting on the destination provider. Secure boot is a security standard developed by members of the PC industry to ensure that a device boots using only software that is trusted by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). 

Workaround: The current workaround is to disable Secure Boot on the destination. For more details, see link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/disabling-secure-boot?view=windows-11[Disabling Secure Boot]. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MTV-1548[(MTV-1548)]
